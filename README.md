  How It Works:
The program uses JavaScript to dynamically generate a password based on the user's selections. It collects selected character types, randomly selects characters from those sets, and then builds a password of the specified length.

The core logic is handled by the generatePassword() function, which:

âž¡Concatenates allowed characters based on checkbox states.
âž¡Uses Math.random() to randomly pick characters.
âž¡Displays the result inside a styled container.
